This is an Arduino sketch to work with the circuit and drive it.

## VarispeedStepperCircuit.fzz

This is a Fritzing file to show the wiring circuit for the electronics.  You might need to install the [Big Easy Driver part](https://github.com/sparkfun/Fritzing_Parts/blob/master/products/12859_big_easy_driver.fzpz) into Fritzing, as it isn't currently part of the standard Fritzing distribution.
